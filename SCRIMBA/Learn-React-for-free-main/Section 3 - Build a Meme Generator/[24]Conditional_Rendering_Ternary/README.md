# Conditional Rendering: Ternary
- The `&&` operator is great if you either want something to display or not display. The `ternary` operator is great if you want to choose between 1 of 2 things to display.
- If your condition is more complex than just having 1 of 2 things to display, usually, it'll be best just to turn to our regular old `else-if` statement to decide what to display.

# Passing state as props
- See the `App.js` and `Count.js` files in this lesson to see how to pass a `state` as a `props` of a `component`.
- Whenever the `state` is changed, React rerenders the `component` where that `state` exists and any `child component` that may rely on that `state` as well.

## Notes
- The code in this lesson is just for syntax reference.

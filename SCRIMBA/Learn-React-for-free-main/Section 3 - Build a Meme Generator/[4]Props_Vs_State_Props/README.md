# Props vs. State: Props
- ```Props``` refer to the properties being ```passed into a component``` in order for it to work correctly, similar to how a function receives parameters: "from above."
- A ```component``` receiving ```props``` is not allowed to modify those props (i.e.they are ```immutable```.)

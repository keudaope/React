# Changing State
- The ```state``` returned by ```useState()``` cannot be changed by assigning it a new value. We need to use the ```function``` which is returned along with the ```state``` to update the ```state```.
- See the ```App.js``` file in this lesson to see how to change ```state```.

## Notes
- The code in this lesson is just for syntax reference.

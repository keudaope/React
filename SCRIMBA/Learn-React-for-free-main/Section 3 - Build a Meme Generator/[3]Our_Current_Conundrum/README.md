# Our Current Conundrum
- React is not looking at local arrays. Therefore, if elements of those arrays are updated, that change won't get rendered automatically.
- In order to make use of the declarative power of React, we need to access ```State``` so that our page gets up dated as soon as we update that data.
- ```React State``` allows us to hook into the components and make it so that whenever we update our state (i.e. values saved inside our components), React will update the UI based on any changes that has happened in our state.

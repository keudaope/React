# useState - Changing State with a Callback function
- The way we change ```state``` in the last lesson works, but it's not the best practice.
- The best practice is to use ```Callback function```.
- See the ```App.js``` file in this lesson to see the best practice in changing ```state```.

## Notes
- The code in this lesson is just for syntax reference.

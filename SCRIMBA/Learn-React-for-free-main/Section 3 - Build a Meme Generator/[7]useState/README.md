# useState
- The method ```useState()``` is part of the React library. It is also know as one of the many ```hooks``` in React.
- We can simply declare some ```state``` by calling
```
React.useState()
```
and pass an ```initial value``` to it.
- Another way to declare ```state``` is to import ```useState```
```
import React, {useState} from "react"
```
then call
```
useState()
```
and pass an ```initial value``` to it.

# Props - Understanding the Concept - Reusable Component
- Looking at the code in the ```index.js``` and ```index.html``` files in this folder, you'll see that passing additional information to our function or element allows us to reuse those function or element in multiple different ways.
- In ```React```, props will help us achieve the same thing. By creating components in ```React``` and passing ```props``` to them, we can reuse those components as many time as we want and in many different ways.

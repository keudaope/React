- Compare the ```Contact.js``` file in this lesson with the one in lesson 5 to see how ```props``` is destructured. Both ways work, however, the way shown in lesson 5 is more preferable.
- Whatever way you choose, try to be consistent with it.

## Notes
- The code in this lesson is just for syntax reference

# Props - Creating a component
- If we just copy and paste a component with some harcoded data in it, we will have absolutely same components again and again. Therefore, to have the same type of component but with different data, we'll need to go to every single component and change every single piece of hardcoded data. This is not efficient at all.
- React offers us a solution to pass data to components so that we do not need to do all these above painful things while reusing our components efficiently.
- We can call the ```props``` we pass in a component ```whatever``` we want

# Set up a local React environment with Create React App
- Firstly, make sure that you have ```node``` and ```npm``` installed on your local machine before we can start
 ```
 node -v
 ```
 ```
 npm -v
 ```
- Once you have those 2 ready, we can start [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Here's a quick start:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
- Now, you can run your React development environment through your terminal.
- Once you have created a React app this way, you'll get some boilerplate code, feel free to delete everything inside the ```src``` folder if you want to code up your app from scratch. Note that you do not need to create the ```index.html``` file inside the ```src``` folder. There's already and ```index.html``` file inside the ```public``` folder.
- Now, when you edit your code and save your changes, the React web app will be automatically reloaded to reflect those changes.

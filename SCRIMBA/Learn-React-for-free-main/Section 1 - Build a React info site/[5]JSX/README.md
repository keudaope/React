# JSX
- What we get from JSX, or rather what React creates with JSX is just plain old JavaScript objects which describe the DOM elements that we want React to put on the page for us.
-> JSX is kinda like a function and when it runs, it returns an object that React can interpret and use to creat actual element that gets rendered on the page.
- With JSX, we need to make sure that we are only returning a single-parent element. However, we can use nested elements.
- You can save a whole bunch of JSX into a single variable and then use that variable kinda like any other variables.
